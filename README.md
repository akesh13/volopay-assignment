# Installation Guide

I designed this project with React and ant design and axios

## Available Scripts

 clone the project and run ## `npm i`  to install all the dependencies


I have used dummy json that only runs on localhost
make sure you have installed json-server in you machine
to install json-server open your terminal and run npm i json-server (refer npm website for additional information)
after installing change directory to server folder (cd server) run ##`json-server --watch db.json --port 8080`
this will run the api in localhost:8080

after that open new terminal run ## `npm start` to run the app


Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
